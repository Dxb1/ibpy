= Description =


The Receiver class is built programatically.  Message types are
defined in the ib.opt.message module, and those types are used to
construct methods on the Receiver class during its definition.
Refer to the ReceiverType metaclass for details.

_Creates method for dispatching messages. _

  {{{
  name: name of method as string
  argnames: list of method argument names
  returns: newly created method (as closure)
