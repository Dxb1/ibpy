IbPy - Interactive Brokers Python API
=====================================
IbPy :release_num: Released :release_date:


What is IbPy?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IbPy is a third-party implementation of the API used for accessing the
Interactive Brokers on-line trading system.  IbPy implements
functionality that the Python programmer can use to connect to IB,
request stock ticker data, submit orders for stocks and futures, and
more.


What's new in this release?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IbPy is all new.  TWS API version :twsapi_ver: is supported.

IbPy is now generated by machine translation of the reference Java
source code provided by Interactive Brokers.  The translation is made
possible by the java2python_ package.

This version has 100% feature parity with the reference
implementation.  All API calls are supported, as are all options of
each call.  An additional interface (similar to the interface provided
by earlier IbPy releases) is also included.

Because the sources are translated, future versions of the TWS API
will be supported in a matter of hours or days (not weeks or worse).


Where can I get IbPy?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IbPy is available for download from Google Code:

How do I use IbPy?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See the IbPy wiki page "Getting Started with IbPy":

    http://code.google.com/p/ibpy/wiki/GettingStarted


What are the requirements?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IbPy requires Python 2.5 or newer.  Previous versions are not supported.

TWS requires a web browser capable of executing Sun(R) Java(tm)
applets.  TWS can also be started directly with Sun(R) Java(tm) and
the stand-alone package supplied by Interactive Brokers.


What is Interactive Brokers?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the page "`About The Interactive Brokers Group`__":

  Interactive Brokers conducts its broker/dealer and proprietary trading
  businesses on 60 market centers worldwide. In its broker dealer agency
  business, IB provides direct access ("on line") trade execution and
  clearing services to institutional and professional traders for a wide
  variety of electronically traded products including options, futures,
  stocks, forex, and bonds worldwide. In its proprietary trading
  business IB engages in market making for its own account in about
  6,500 different electronically traded products. Interactive Brokers
  Group and its affiliates now trade 19% of the worldâ€™s exchange traded
  equity options*, and executes approximately 500,000 trades per day.


What is Python?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the page "`What is Python?`__":

  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
  language.  It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.

  Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has
  modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and
  dynamic typing.  There are interfaces to many system calls and
  libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
  Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python
  is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a
  programmable interface.

  The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX,
  on Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If your favorite system isn't
  listed here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for
  it. Ask around on comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python
  yourself.

  The Python implementation is copyrighted but freely usable and distributable,
  even for commercial use.


What Else?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IbPy is not a product of Interactive Brokers, nor am I affiliated with
IB.  I am a satisfied IB customer, of course.

IbPy is installed with distutils.  Refer to the Python distutils
documentation for more information.  The digest version is::
